## Schema Design

Below is the visual representation of the database structure:

![TABLE_diagram](./diagrams/diagrama_tables.png)

### Entity Relationship Diagram

![ER_diagram](./diagrams/diagrama_er.png)

### Table manager

This defines the relational database schema for the PawPoint system using SQLAlchemy Core.
It centralizes table definitions, constraints, and relationships, and provides a utility class to initialize the database structure.

The database connection URL is loaded from environment variables using python-dotenv.

```python
URL_POSTGRES=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

#### Purpose

The TablesManager class is responsible for:

- Creating the SQLAlchemy engine
- Holding metadata definitions
- Initializing all database tables

Usage Example:

```py
from tables import TablesManager

manager = TablesManager()
manager.create_tables()
manager.engine
manager.user_table
```

### Table Structures

#### user table

**Description:** Stores user account information and authentication data.

| Column   | Type    | Constraints | Description                |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| id       | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY | Unique user identifier     |
| name     | VARCHAR | NOT NULL    | User's full name           |
| password | VARCHAR | NOT NULL    | Hashed password            |
| role     | VARCHAR | NOT NULL    | User role: 'user', 'admin' |

##### Business Rules:

- Password must be hashed before storage
- Role determines access permissions
- Valid roles: 'user' (default), 'admin'

---

#### product table

**Description:** Product catalog with inventory management.

| Column | Type    | Constraints                   | Description                       |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| id     | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY                   | Unique product identifier         |
| sku    | VARCHAR | UNIQUE, NOT NULL              | Stock Keeping Unit (product code) |
| name   | VARCHAR | NOT NULL                      | Product name                      |
| price  | INTEGER | NOT NULL, CHECK (price > 0)   | Product price in cents            |
| amount | INTEGER | NOT NULL, CHECK (amount >= 0) | Available stock quantity          |

##### Business Rules:

- Price is stored in cents to avoid floating-point precision issues
- Amount represents current inventory stock
- Products with amount = 0 are out of stock
- SKU must be unique across all products
- Price must always be positive (greater than 0)
- Stock (amount) cannot be negative
- When product is added to cart, verify sufficient stock
- Stock is decremented when receipt is generated, not when added to cart

---

#### cart table

**Description:** Shopping carts for users to collect products before checkout.

| Column  | Type    | Constraints                | Description                               |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| id      | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY                | Unique cart identifier                    |
| id_user | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL      | Reference to user who owns the cart       |
| state   | VARCHAR | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'active' | Cart status: 'active','bought', 'archive' |

##### Business Rules:

- Each user should have just one 'active' cart
- State changes: active to bought, after receipt was generated
- When user creates new cart, previous active cart automatic will be marked archive
- When receipt is generated, also generate a new active cart

---

#### cart_item table

**Description:** Individual items within shopping carts (junction table between cart and product).

| Column     | Type     | Constraints           | Description                 |

| id_cart    | INTEGER  | FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL | Reference to cart           |
| id_product | INTEGER  | FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL | Reference to product        |
| amount     | INTERGER | NOT NULL              | Quantity of product         |

**Business Rules:**

- Validate product stock availability before adding to cart
- Amount (quantity) must be positive integer (> 0)

| id_user  | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL | Reference to user who owns the address |
| location | VARCHAR | NOT NULL              | Full address string                    |

**Business Rules:**

- Users can have multiple saved addresses
- Location should include complete address: street, city, state, postal code, country
- Addresses cannot be deleted if used in receipts (preserve history)
- Users must have at least one address before checkout
- When user is deleted, their addresses are deleted (CASCADE)

---

#### payment table

**Description:** User payment methods (credit cards, PayPal, etc.).
